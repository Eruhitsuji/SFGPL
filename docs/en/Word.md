|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|apple|Noun|fa 'apple'|
|open|Verb|sa 'open'|
|tall|Modifier|la 'tall'|

## About unique words

The SFGPL provides several unique words for verbs and modifiers.
In the WordV and WordM classes, these are word groups that are unique to the SFGPL.

These word groups are highly versatile because their parts of speech have already been determined and they have a broad meaning, but it is difficult to specify the details of their meaning.

The following table gives examples of unique words.

|English|SFGPL|
|:-:|:-:|
|create|kan|
|big|wan|

Examples using these words are shown below.

|English|SFGPL|
|:-:|:-:|
|I create a door.|te ga kan fa 'door'|
|The apple is big.|me fa 'apple' so wan|

## About the determiners

The SFGPL has a [noun determiner](DeterminerN.md).
This is a special word that originally modifies a noun.
However, they can also be used as nouns in the same sense as the determiners themselves.
To do so, use ```fo```.
Examples are given in the following table.

|English|SFGPL|
|:-:|:-:|
|human|ben fo|

Examples using these words are shown below.

|English|SFGPL|
|:-:|:-:|
|I am human.|ma ga so ben fo|

## About meaningless words

There are words in the SFGPL that do not add meaning.
These words exist for each part of speech and are used when grammatically necessary.

```fo``` is often used to express [noun determiners](DeterminerN.md) as they are.
Also, ```so``` is used when a verb is not needed, especially in [sentence pattern](sentence_pattern.md).
On the other hand, ```lo``` is rarely used.
Examples of these are given below.

|English|SFGPL|
|:-:|:-:|
|I am human.|ma ga so ben fo|
|I have an apple.|mi ga so fa 'apple'|

||SFGPL|
