The SFGPL allows you to create sentences that combine several within a single sentence.

## Parallel clauses

A [conjunction](Conjunction.md) is used to connect two or more sentences in parallel.

In the SFGPL, "I went to Tokyo and I was shopping there." can be expressed as follows.

```SFGPL
ba di ta ga na sa 'go' li pun fa 'Tokyo' di ta ga na ni sa 'shop' li pun gu
```

And while English-like tense agreement requires clause-by-clause utilisation in this way, the SFGPL allows the basic tense to be utilised throughout the sentence.

```SFGPL
di ba ta ga na sa 'go' li pun fa 'Tokyo' ta ga na ni sa 'shop' li pun gu
```

## Dependent clauses

A subordinate modification of a noun in the main clause can be achieved by inserting a sentence describing the noun instead of the noun.
In addition, the SFGPL generally uses subordinate clauses to modify nouns.

### General subordinate clauses

In the SFGPL, "My bag is big." can be expressed as follows.
In this case, "My bag" is expressed as "I have a bag".
The noun is then marked with ```san``` because "bag" is the noun being modified.

```SFGPL
me mi ga so san fa 'bag' so wan
```

The meaning of "I have a bag is big." is almost the same as "I have a bag is big.
In this case, the "bag" in "a bag is big" is the subject of the subordinate clause, so ```san``` need not be added.

```SFGPL
mi ga so me fa 'bag' so wan
```

Then, to express "I give you the desk I built.", do the following.

```SFGPL
ti ga so ge di te ga sa 'build' san fa 'desk'
```

The tense of only the subordinate clause can be changed in this way.

### Adverbial clauses

Adverbial clauses can be used to modify predicates and whole sentences.
In the SFGPL, "I ate sushi, when I went to Tokyo." can be expressed as follows.

```SFGPL
di te ga na sa 'eat' li ta ga na sa 'go' li pun fa 'Tokyo' fa 'sushi'
```

Or, to express "I went grocery shopping while my kids were sleeping." in the SFGPL.

```SFGPL
di ta ga na sa 'go' ba li ma fi ni sa 'shop' so fa 'grocery' li ta mi ga so san don fa 'kid' ni sa 'sleep'
```
