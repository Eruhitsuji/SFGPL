Thus, there are three tenses in the SFGPL: ① past tense, ② present tense, and ③ future tense.
These tenses are fundamental to verb conjugation and serve as reference points for sentence time.
Example sentences using the tenses are shown in the following table.

|Tense|English|SFGPL|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|①Past Tense|I lived in Tokyo.|di ta ga na sa 'live' li pun fa 'Tokyo'|
|②Present Tense|I live in Tokyo.|ta ga na sa 'live' li pun fa 'Tokyo'|
|③Future Tense|I will live in Tokyo.|du ta ga na sa 'live' li pun fa 'Tokyo'|

In particular, ```di``` and ```du``` are attached to the sentence itself.

## Perfect tense

In the SFGPL, there is a perfect tense equivalent to English, as shown in the figure below.

This perfect tense is used to indicate that something that has happened in the past is continuing.
Examples of the perfect tense for the three tenses are as follows.

|Tense|English|SFGPL|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|①Past Perfect Tense|I had lived in Tokyo.|di ta ga nu na sa 'live' li pun fa 'Tokyo'|
|②Present Perfect Tense|I have lived in Tokyo.|ta ga nu na sa 'live' li pun fa 'Tokyo'|
|③Future Perfect Tense|I will have lived in Tokyo.|du ta ga nu na sa 'live' li pun fa 'Tokyo'|

In ```nu```, the perfective form is attached to and modifies the verb itself.

## 進行形

The SFGPL can be expressed in the progressive form meaning "I am wearing the dress." as follows.

```te ga ni sa 'wear' fa 'dress'```

Progressive forms ```ni``` are attached to verbs.
They can be past or future tense as well as present tense.
"I am wearing the dress." in the past and future tenses is as follows.

di te ga ni sa 'wear' fa 'dress'
du te ga ni sa 'wear' fa 'dress'
```

## Passive voice
