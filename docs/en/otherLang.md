[TOP](../../readme.md)

[JP](../jp/otherLang.md)

The SFGPL also allows the use of loanwords that are not of English origin.
In such cases, the usage is basically the same as for English.
However, the word order cannot be changed, so it may differ from the word order of the original language.

## Borrowed words of Japanese origin

For example, to form the sentence "私はりんごを持っている。", use the following.

```SFGPL
mi ga so fa 'りんご'
```

The sentence "私の鞄は赤い。", which [Compound Sentences](CompoundSentences.md) contains, should be as follows.

```SFGPL
me mi ga so san fa '鞄' so la '赤い'
```

## Borrowed words of Esperanto origin

When using Esperanto words as loan words, it is recommended that, as a rule, the form without the part-of-speech suffix should be used.

For example, to form the sentence "Mi havas pomon." do the following.

```SFGPL
mi ga so fa 'pom'
```

For example, to form the sentence "Mia sako estas ruĝa." do the following.

```SFGPL
me mi ga so san fa 'sak' so la 'ruĝ'
```
