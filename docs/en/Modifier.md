## About modifiers

There is no difference between adjectives and adverbs in the SFGPL; all words that modify are modifiers.

Modifiers provide words to express the opposite of the modification.
It is thereby possible to make ```wan``` corresponding to the English word "big" into ```ke wan```, which means "small".

## Comparative expressions

The SFGPL has a ```mo``` of sentences that make comparisons between nouns of two terms.
```mo A F B C```, meaning "A is more B than C.".

Comparative expressions such as "My table is bigger than yours." are expressed as follows.

```SFGPL
mo mi ga so san fa 'table' so wan sen ge
```

## Modifiers for each part of speech

To simply modify each part of speech with a modifier, the following table is used.

|:-:|:-:|
|Noun|me Noun Modifier|
|Verb|na Verb Modifier|
|Modifier|ka Modifier Modifier|

## Applications of modifiers

Modifiers allow us to substitute English prepositions and noun phrases as modifiers.
In this case, the ```li```, which converts nouns to modifiers, and [noun determiners](DeterminerN.md) are often combined to form expressions.
For example, "I live in Tokyo.".

```SFGPL
ta ga na sa 'live' li pun fa 'Tokyo'
```

The ```pun``` is a determiner of place.
