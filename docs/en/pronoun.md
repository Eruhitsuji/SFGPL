## Pronoun applications

As a rule, SFGPL pronouns do not distinguish between people, organisms, objects, concepts, places, times, reasons, methods, etc.
There is no distinction based on gender or number.
These distinctions can be made by using [noun determiner](DeterminerN.md).


The following table shows the use of noun determiners for interrogatives.

|English|SFGPL|
|:-:|:-:|
|what|pen wa|
|who|ben wa|
|when|pin wa|
|where|pun wa|
|why|pon wa|
|how|ban wa|

To indicate plurals, use ```don```.
For example, ```don ga``` is used to denote "We".

Gender distinctions do not exist in the SFGPL.
Nor is there a distinction between persons and things.
For example, to make explicit the third person pronouns masculine, feminine and thing, one can do the following.

||English|SFGPL|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|male|he|lan gi|
|female|she|len gi|
|thing|it|pen gi|

In addition, you can create possessive and reflexive pronouns using ```sen``` and ```sin```.
The following table shows the possessive and reflexive pronouns for first person pronouns.

||English|SFGPL|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Possessive Pronoun|mine|sen ga|
|Reflexive Pronoun|myself|sin ga|
