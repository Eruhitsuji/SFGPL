Basically, the SFGPL must adhere strictly to the grammar as described in [sentence pattern](sentence_pattern.md), but the rest may be decided to some extent by the user.
However, an exemplary grammar is described in this chapter.

## How to qualify a sentence

To modify a whole sentence, you basically modify the verbs in that sentence by using ```na```.
For example, in the example sentence "I go to Tokyo.", the "to Tokyo" part is a modifier.
In this case, the SFGPL uses the following.

```SFGPL
ta ga na sa 'go' li pun fa 'Tokyo'
```

Another alternative is to use ```me```.

```SFGPL
me ta ga sa 'go' so li pun fa 'Tokyo'
```

### Prepositional usage in English

In particular, when modifying verbs, like prepositions in English, they are expressed using ```li``` and [DeterminerN](DeterminerN.md).
Examples of English prepositions and SFGPLs are given in the following table.
