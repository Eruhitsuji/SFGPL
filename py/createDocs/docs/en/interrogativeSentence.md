## Yesâ€“no question

Use ```{phrase_interrogative}``` to create interrogative sentences.
When this word is added to a sentence, it becomes a interrogative sentence.
"You have a table." is ```{you_have_a_table}``` under the SFGPL.
To make it mean "Do you have a table?", it can be expressed as follows in the SFGPL.

```SFGPL
{do_you_have_a_table}
```

Such a question reply is expressed by using Bool.B2N```{Bool_B2N}``` to indicate whether the proposition is true or false, as follows.

```SFGPL
{yes_I_have_it}
{no_I_dont_have_it}
```

## wh-questions

In the case of interrogative sentences containing interrogatives, the indefinite is expressed by replacing the indefinite with an interrogative.

"Who has a table?" is expressed as follows.

```SFGPL
{who_has_a_table}
