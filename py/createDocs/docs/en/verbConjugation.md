Verb tenses exist in the SFGPL as shown in the figure below.

Thus, there are three tenses in the SFGPL: ① past tense, ② present tense, and ③ future tense.
These tenses are fundamental to verb conjugation and serve as reference points for sentence time.
Example sentences using the tenses are shown in the following table.

|Tense|English|SFGPL|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|①Past Tense|I lived in Tokyo.|{I_lived_in_Tokyo}|
|②Present Tense|I live in Tokyo.|{I_live_in_Tokyo}|
|③Future Tense|I will live in Tokyo.|{I_will_live_in_Tokyo}|

In particular, ```{phrase_past}``` and ```{phrase_future}``` are attached to the sentence itself.

## Perfect tense

In the SFGPL, there is a perfect tense equivalent to English, as shown in the figure below.

This perfect tense is used to indicate that something that has happened in the past is continuing.
Examples of the perfect tense for the three tenses are as follows.

|Tense|English|SFGPL|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|①Past Perfect Tense|I had lived in Tokyo.|{I_had_lived_in_Tokyo}|
|②Present Perfect Tense|I have lived in Tokyo.|{I_have_lived_in_Tokyo}|
|③Future Perfect Tense|I will have lived in Tokyo.|{I_will_have_lived_in_Tokyo}|

In ```{verb_perfective}```, the perfective form is attached to and modifies the verb itself.

## 進行形

The SFGPL can be expressed in the progressive form meaning "I am wearing the dress." as follows.

```{I_am_wearing_the_dress}```

Progressive forms ```{verb_progressive}``` are attached to verbs.
They can be past or future tense as well as present tense.
"I am wearing the dress." in the past and future tenses is as follows.

```SFGPL
{I_was_wearing_the_dress}
{I_will_be_wearing_the_dress}
```

## Passive voice

SFGPL can express the passive voice with the meaning "The dress is worn.".

```{the_dress_is_worn}```

The ```{verb_passive}```, which indicates the passive form, is attached to the verb.
These can be in the past or future tense as well as the present tense.
"The dress is worn." in the past and future tenses is as follows.

```SFGPL
{the_dress_was_worn}
{the_dress_will_be_worn}
