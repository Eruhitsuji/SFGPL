In this chapter, examples of usage for Japanese are presented.
In particular, examples are given for cases where the loanword is Japanese.

Basically, the same usage as in English can be used.
However, the word order cannot be changed, so it differs from natural Japanese.

For example, to form the sentence "私はりんごを持っている", use the following.

```SFGPL
{私はりんごを持っている}
```

The sentence "私の鞄は赤い", which [Compound Sentences]({docs_CompoundSentences}) contains, should be as follows.

```SFGPL
{私の鞄は赤い}
```
