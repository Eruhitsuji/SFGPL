## About modifiers

There is no difference between adjectives and adverbs in the SFGPL; all words that modify are modifiers.

Modifiers provide words to express the opposite of the modification.
It is thereby possible to make ```{WordM_big}``` corresponding to the English word "big" into ```{Neg_WordM_big}```, which means "small".

## Comparative expressions

The SFGPL has a ```{Noun_gt}``` of sentences that make comparisons between nouns of two terms.
```{Noun_gt} A F B C```, meaning "A is more B than C.".

## Modifiers for each part of speech

To simply modify each part of speech with a modifier, the following table is used.

||SFGPL|
|:-:|:-:|
|Noun|{Modifier_N} Noun Modifier|
|Verb|{Modifier_V} Verb Modifier|
|Modifier|{Modifier_M} Modifier Modifier|

## Applications of modifiers

Modifiers allow us to substitute English prepositions and noun phrases as modifiers.
In this case, the ```{Modifier_N2M}```, which converts nouns to modifiers, and [noun determiners]({docs_DeterminerN}) are often combined to form expressions.
For example, "I live in Tokyo.".

```SFGPL
{I_live_in_Tokyo}
```

The ```{DeterminerN_place}``` is a determiner of place.
