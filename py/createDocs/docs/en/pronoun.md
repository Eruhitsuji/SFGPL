## Pronoun applications

As a rule, SFGPL pronouns do not distinguish between people, organisms, objects, concepts, places, times, reasons, methods, etc.
There is no distinction based on gender or number.
These distinctions can be made by using [noun determiner]({docs_DeterminerN}).

### Interrogative word

The following table shows the use of noun determiners for interrogatives.

|English|SFGPL|
|:-:|:-:|
|what|{pronoun_what}|
|who|{pronoun_who}|
|when|{pronoun_when}|
|where|{pronoun_where}|
|why|{pronoun_why}|
|how|{pronoun_how}|

### Plural pronouns

To indicate plurals, use ```{determinerN_plural}```.
For example, ```{pronoun_we}``` is used to denote "We".

### Examples of conjugation of third person pronouns

Gender distinctions do not exist in the SFGPL.
Nor is there a distinction between persons and things.
For example, to make explicit the third person pronouns masculine, feminine and thing, one can do the following.

||English|SFGPL|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|male|he|{pronoun_he_male}|
|female|she|{pronoun_he_female}|
|thing|it|{pronoun_he_thing}|

### Possessive and Recursive pronouns

In addition, you can create possessive and reflexive pronouns using ```{determinerN_possessive}``` and ```{determinerN_reflexive}```.
The following table shows the possessive and reflexive pronouns for first person pronouns.
